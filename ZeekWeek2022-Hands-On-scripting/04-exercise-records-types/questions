task 1) can we keep track of start and end times for each ip pairs

Extra-credit: You've got a list of blacklisted IP addresses. You need to find
    (i)   how many of those IPs attempted connection,
    (ii)  when was each remote IP first_seen and last_seen,
    (iii) how long had the remote IP been active for
    (iv)  when were they last_active
    (v)   how many local hosts did each remote host connected to
    (vi)  how many total connections ?

    Extra credit++ : do this at scale: the blacklist has 10M IPs.
